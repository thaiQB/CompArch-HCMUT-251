Case 1 - Simple sine wave (mild noise)
---------------------------------------
Parameters:
- Desired signal: d[n] = sin(2π . 0.2 . n)
- White noise σ = 0.1
- Sinusoidal noise amplitude = 0.1, frequency = 0.3

Reasoning:
- σ = 0.1 introduces a low-level Gaussian disturbance that still allows the sine wave to be visible - a good test for basic correctness.
- The sinusoidal interference has a slightly higher frequency (0.3) than the main signal (0.2), ensuring no spectral overlap.
-> This allows the Wiener filter to effectively suppress the interference by leveraging frequency-domain separability.

Purpose:
- Acts as a baseline scenario to confirm that the filter correctly estimates the underlying sinusoid with low MMSE.
- Also establishes the expected visual pattern for subsequent, more complex testcases.
